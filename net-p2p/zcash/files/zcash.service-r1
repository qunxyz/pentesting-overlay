# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because
# it will be overwritten during package upgrades.
# If you want to customize, the best way is to create file 
# "/etc/systemd/system/zcash.service.d/*.conf"
# containing your changes

# For example, if you want to change some daemon and/or
# unit options, create a file named
# "/etc/systemd/system/zcash.service.d/myopts.conf"
# containing:
#     [Service]
#     Environment="ZCASHD_OPTS=-debug -logtimestamps"
#     Nice=10
# This will override the setting appearing below.

# Note that almost all daemon options could be specified in
# /etc/zcash/zcash.conf
