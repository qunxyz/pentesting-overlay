# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades. If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create file
# "/etc/systemd/system/spiderfoot.service.d/*.conf"
# containing your changes

# Note that almost all daemon options could be specified in
# /etc/spiderfoot/spiderfoot.conf
