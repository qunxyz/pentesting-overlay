 # check for EGL
 set (with_egl no)  # although EGL can be used with X (replacing GLX), it requires drivers that support DRI2, so most of the time GLX works better; so it's disabled by default for now; later, it will be required for Wayland, and we'll have to decide whether we compile with both, or whether we load one of them as a plug-in at run-time. It may depend on EGL having been built to support a given graphic target.
